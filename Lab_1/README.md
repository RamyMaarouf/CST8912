# CST8912 - Lab Activity #1 Report

### Analysis of Lab Activity

- The successful provisioning of the VM in Azure demonstrates a practical application of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). By selecting the VM size, configuring a disk, and using SSH public key authentication, we were able to create a highly-performant, secure, and customizable compute instance.
- This process highlights how IaaS allows us to directly manage and control fundamental cloud resources, such as compute, storage, and networking.
- Furthermore, the integration with a Log Analytics Workspace showcases the importance of monitoring in cloud management, providing the capability to collect and analyze operational data for performance and security purposes.
- The SSH connection and subsequent execution of commands like uname -a and df -h confirmed that the VM was not just a static instance but a fully functional, remotely accessible server ready for deployment and management tasks.
